# Fitness-Pal
Fitness Pal is an AI based web app that allows users to evaluate and improve their form. Users can input video through live video, or if preferred, upload a video. Our model is made based on the latest technology available, and will ensure that all aspects of your exercise are evaluated. Once you are done inputting your video, our AI generated results will give you a grade as well as some tips you could follow to improve your form. There are also videos available to improve your form.

## About 
Our inspiration comes from the thousands of people that develop injuries in the gym from poor form. This issue hits close to home because I have seen my close friend injure himself really severely due to bad form. After seeing him get injured I thought to myself “how can I prevent this”. 

Later on, we did more research on this topic and realized this issue is much more common than we thought. According to the national library of medicine, “35% of people who do weights with incorrect form develop a serious injury”. After reading about this, we wanted to make sure no one gets injured from using bad form again  

Thus we developed Fitness Pall, an AI-based program explicitly designed to prevent injury by helping new gym members with their form.
